infinite series sums
n + n-1 + n-2..... == n(n+1)/2  == big 0(n^2)



summing big O
nlogn + n = nlogn 
* because it's the bigger term


Algorithms:

palindrome:  
string with even length: even number of all characters
string with odd length: even number of all characters except one
optimized final algorithm: any string with no more than one cahracter with an odd count



Strategy:

Bit Vector Array: an array of 0/1 useful for testing even odd character counts
