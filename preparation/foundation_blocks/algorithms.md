## Algorithms


### infinite series sums
* n + n-1 + n-2..... == n(n+1)/2  == big 0(n^2)

### palindrome:  
* string with even length: even number of all characters
* string with odd length: even number of all characters except one
* optimized final algorithm: any string with no more than one cahracter with an odd count
* strategy:
    * Bit Vector Array: an array of 0/1 useful for testing even odd character counts

### regex:
* lazy vs greedy quantifiers

* lookahead?
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45504400/regex-match-pattern-of-alternating-characters

### Factorial
* factorial = 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4


## Big O
* https://adrianmejia.com/most-popular-algorithms-time-complexity-every-programmer-should-know-free-online-tutorial-course/
* summing big O
    * nlogn + n = nlogn 
    * because it's the bigger term


## Permutation vs Combination
* permutation
    * Permutation is the action of rearranging objects, characters or symbols into different, unique sequences.
    * Each sequence is called ‘permutation’.
* combination
    * order does not matter

### Problem Solving Strategies
* would sorting help?


### in place vs another data structure
### Hashing
### Sorting 
### Divide And Conquor
### greedy algorithm
### graph algorithm
### dynamic programming
